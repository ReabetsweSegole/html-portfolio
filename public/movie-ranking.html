<h2>Top 3 movies 2023</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Action packed</h3>
<p>The Equalizer 3</p>
    Denzel Washington yet again put us at the edge of our seats. It is set in Italy this time, with co-star Dakota Flaming. Denzel gives us an heroic character, we have all grown to love.
<h3>Family fun</h3>     
<p>Leo</p>
Adam Sandler as main character, Leo is a reflective movie. It will leave asking "what more could I have done in my life."
<h3>Nostalgia</h3> 
<p>Matlida</p>
It never misses a beat. It still warms my heart just like the very time I watched. I will soon reveiw the musical on Netflix. <p>stay tuned for more</p>
